# Game of Apps Development Intern Interview
### Submission: Joe Dai

> Thanks for your interest in the Game of Apps developer intern position! This repo contains a list of tasks for you to do, so we can get a gauge of your skill and passion for development.
>
> You're expected to know the basics of the Git development workflow. If you don't know or you want a review, check out this [tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/179717/open-source-collaboration-using-git-and-github).

## Instructions

> The goal is to submit a pull request that accomplishes the following tasks. While the pull requests are public, don't blindly copy others. The follow up interview will involve questions on your submission.
>
> Fork this repository to begin.
>
> Commit your changes to your fork, then email the link of your fork to careers@gameofapps.org.

## Challenge 1: Algorithms

> Your first challenge is to solve two algorithm questions. You'll be judged based on correctness, performance, and code readability.

**See solution at: [Algorithms.java](./Algorithms/src/main/xyz/jdtec/algorithms/Algorithms.java)**
 
**See JUnit tests at: [AlgorithmsTest.java](./Algorithms/src/test/xyz/jdtec/algorithms/AlgorithmsTest.java)**

> ### Question 1: Find all pairs for a given sum
>
> Create a function that accepts an array of integers and a target sum. The function will print all pairs of integers in the array whose sum is equal to the target sum. Here's an example:
>
> ```java
> int[] testArray = {2, 4, 5, 1, 3, 5, 4};
> int targetSum = 6;
> // Expected pairs are (to be printed on the console):
> // (2, 4)
> // (1, 5)
> 
> findPairs(testArray, targetSum);
> ```
>
> Here's a function signature to start you off:
>
> ```java
> void findPairs(int[] testArray, int targetSum) {
>   // your code here
> }
> ```
>
> ### Question 2: Is Palindrome?
> 
> Create a function that checks if a string is a palindrome and returns `true` or `false`. A palindrome is a word that reads the same way even if you read it backwards.
> 
> Example palindromes:
> 
> - radar
> - bob
> - asdfdsa
> 
> Here's a function signature to start you off:
> 
> ```java
> boolean isPalindrome(String testString) {
>   // your code here
> }
> ```

## Challenge 2: Android

> Your second challenge is to develop a small app from scratch. Here are the requirements:
> 
> - It should show a list of images.
> - Tapping on an image should navigate to a new screen that shows the selected picture

**See app solution at: [Android App](./Android%20App/app/src/main)**

> ### Notes:
> 
> - A good developer tries to write code that is easy to understand. The industry has a set of best practices that focus on writing easy to maintain code. Here's a set of guidelines on these best practices: [Java Style Guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/java-style-guide).
